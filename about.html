    <h2 class="center-text">About me</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16;">I am a second-year student pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering at New Horizon College of Engineering. I have a strong foundation in web development technologies, particularly excelling in HTML for structuring web content and demonstrating proficiency in CSS for styling and layout. Additionally, I possess in-depth knowledge of Java and have achieved an advanced level of expertise in this programming language.

        Moreover, I have a solid grasp of web design, including HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, enabling me to create captivating and interactive web experiences. I also have a fundamental understanding of C, which has broadened my programming skills and problem-solving capabilities. In addition, I have explored various programming languages, including Python, during my academic journey. While my exposure to Python was during my second semester, I am confident that, with some review and additional study materials, I can quickly regain proficiency in the language.
        
        My passion for technology and web development fuels my academic pursuits, and I am enthusiastic about continuing to enhance my skills and explore new horizons in the field of Computer Science and Engineering.. </p>
